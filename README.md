# Security-based-face-recognition
-> Objective of this project was to develop a fast and robust face recognition system that is invariant to changes such as illumination, expressions and occlusions by exploring features in image - space, scale and orientation. 

-> Algorithm was based on Local Gabor binary pattern histogram sequence (LGBPHS) for improved feature matching and efficiency. 

-> Used MATLAB with Image Processing Tool Box to implement the project.
